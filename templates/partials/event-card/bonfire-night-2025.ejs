        Make your way to the stunning backdrop of Smeaton's Tower lighthouse, where the bonfire awaits. You will also spot Guy Fawkes sitting on top of the bonfire, created by the amazing team at Plymouth Play Scrapstore! Bask in the heat from the grand lighting of the bonfire from 7.30pm. 
    
        At 8pm, the sky will burst into a dazzling display of fireworks. Watch in awe as rockets, fountains, and firecrackers paint the Plymouth sky from the Royal Citadel.`,
